# outpatient-demographic-data
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to create a table that reflects realistic proportions of hospital outpatient attendances and non-attendances based on demographic data. The source data is from the "Outpatient attendances by age and gender 2023-24" table provided by the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), NHS England.
